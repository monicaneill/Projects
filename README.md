<b> Python Number Guessing Game </b>

Here you will be able to view my open source code, version 1 (beta) and version 2 (alpha). In order to launch the 'game' and interact with it yourself, click on pythonguessinggame.exe and then click download. Your computer's security system might try and block the program, click on 'more information' and 'run anyway'. A terminal will pop up and you will then be able to interact with the game!
